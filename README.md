# Media Query Homework Submission

## Active URL

[Site available here.](http://walkerportfolio.com/hw_mq_walker_jon/)

## Resource Links

[w3 Schools.](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp)

Used to reference correct media query syntax.

[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-commit-message/)

Used to reference how to amend a previous commit after having made other commits. Ultimately, I just started a new repo because I had forgotten to rename the repo at the beginning anyhow.

## Comments

None.
